# personalWebsitePt2

This repository is a personal website about myself, Nicole Park.

It has three main html files that showcase me. On the Home page I introduce myself, on the About page I tell a little about who I am, what I enjoy and about my family. On the Portfolio page I showcase the projects that I have worked on individually and with a team.

It also has a CSS style sheet showing what styles I have incorporated into my website.

And it has a JavaScript page which for right now just says "hello" to my awsome instructors!
